        "post": "So you are finally here! I welcome you to this blog. Since a long time I wanted to code and run a blog to share my knowledge with the world. A blog with full of futuristic tech posts and a blog with a special interest in space-faring future. Thanks to a school project - it is finally here - 'Re-Think'.<br><br>The name of the blog may be way too old and not so suited but it literally took me a day to think of a name (yes, this <em>rethink</em> type name). But anyways, I hope the readers and viewers will manage the vintage-ness of the name and pardon me for that.<br><br>Okay, so let's get to the point - what can the readers expect from this blog? Umm.. before telling you this - would you mind me giving a few seconds of your reading in knowing a bit about me? ...thanks :) So, I am a random programmer and a futurist techie in general (that's it).<br><br>Pardon for the interruption but let's start with the expectations now. You can expect blog posts from a varied range of topics but everything under the general umbrella of <em>futurism</em>. Anything related to engineering, technology, philosophy, psychology can be found. The posts will be designed and written in such a way (I hope so) that the readers won't lose their interest in them.<br>....<br>....<br>(Wondering what else should be included in the introduction post...) I guess that's it for the welcoming of our readers.<br><br>See you around.. reading :)"

        "post": "<h2>What do I mean by this?</h2><p>Let's wait a while and look into our lives and our purpose on the planet Earth. We all are here for a reason. Whether you believe in optimism, pessimism or nihilism, all things get break down into a very fundamental truth -<strong> \" We all want to find our purpose, and live it \"</strong>. Life just can't be about waking up in the morning , hustle for 'no' particular reason , sleep and then repeat. There has to be a 'good' reason for everything you do. You code - why? You study - why? Hopefully you know the answers to these questions but if you are unable to give answers - continue reading and those who can shall continue reading too.</p><div class=\"center\"><img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/24/Black_Cliffs%27_Lake%2C_Lagodekhi_Protected_Area%2C_Georgia_02.jpg/800px-Black_Cliffs%27_Lake%2C_Lagodekhi_Protected_Area%2C_Georgia_02.jpg\" alt=\"image-1\"><cite>Our planet is beautiful.</cite></div><h2>How can \"you\" add value?</h2><p>Yes, you can add values to the world , to your surroundings. Adding values doesn't necessarily mean doing something 'extraordinary' - no, nope, not at all.<br>Cracking a joke at someone to make them laugh, helping a person in need - congratulations you are \"adding\" values to this world. Determine one action you can take to add value to a friend, family member, colleague, or humanity as a whole.<br><strong>Be kind to yourself and others.</strong><br>\"No action of kindness, no matter how small, is ever wasted\" - Aesop.Value can be given in the everyday moments of life – something as simple as a smile or a helping hand. However, value is also recognizing someone’s passion, supporting their mission, and driving their purpose.</p><div class=\"center\"><img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/22/Astronomy_Amateur_3_V2.jpg/800px-Astronomy_Amateur_3_V2.jpg\" alt=\"image-2\"><cite>You have a purpose.</cite></div><h2>See inside yourself.</h2><p>I will start with a very simple question : What do you want to do in your life? A common question teenagers and even young adults are asked all the time by their teachers, parents or elders. This question is not that simple. It requires deep investigation of yourself by you. If you are able to give an answer to this question without doubts or hesitations then hats-off to you. But how will you accomplish your goal then?<br>Most of the people aren't aware about what they 'really' want to do in their life. So, let's get straight to the 'Hard-hitting' questions.</p><div class=\"center\"><img class=\"star\" src=\"https://cdn.kastatic.org/third_party/javascript-khansrc/live-editor/build/images/space/star.png\" alt=\"image-3\"><cite>Everyone is a star.</cite></div><h2>The Hard-hitting Blunt Questions</h2><p>1. What do you really love to do, something that you are passionate about?<br>2. What do you believe the world needs (from you) to make it better?<br>3. What unique qualities do you possess?<br><br>Grab a pen and paper and write the answers to these questions. Read them several times and hopefully you will be able to know what you 'really' want/have to do.</p><div class=\"center\"><img src=\"https://cdn.kastatic.org/third_party/javascript-khansrc/live-editor/build/images/food/bananas.png\" alt=\"image-3\"><cite>Do you want to give the world healthy bananas?</cite></div><br>"

        "post": "I read an article online on the equation <b>0.8 * 0.2 = 0.16</b><br><br>If you observe this equation really closely, you will see that the product <em>(0.16)</em> is smaller than the numbers multiplied <b>(0.8 and 0.2)</b>.<br>But, multiplication is adding and adding always increases! This is definitely somethings to ponder upon.<br><br><div class='cem'><img src=\"/resources/media/post3equation.png\" alt=\"eq\"></div><br>If you really go in deep mathematically, then this starts making sense as we are adding 0.8 0.2 times i.e. ofcourse adding less than its actual value, so the product indeed makes sense. Yes, certainly but try taking a look into the equation a bit psychologically and philosophically.<br><br>Let's get to focus. This equation explains a very useful life lesson. If we put less effort or focus into something then we are indeed spending the same amount of time but getting reduced return. If we put out 100% focus into something then we get exponentially increasing results and vice-versa as you have already seen.<br><br>I'd suggest you to write this equation on a piece of paper and paste it somewhere around your workplace to remind yourself how important your time and efforts are.<br>"
