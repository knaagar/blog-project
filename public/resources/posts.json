A blog with full of futuristic tech posts and a blog with a special interest in space-faring future. Thanks to a school project - it is finally here - 'Re-Think'.<br><br>The name of the blog may be way too old and not so suited but it literally took me a day to think of a name (yes, this <em>rethink</em> type name). But anyways, I hope the readers and viewers will manage the vintage-ness of the name and pardon me for that.<br><br>Okay, so let's get to the point - what can the readers expect from this blog? Umm.. before telling you this - would you mind me giving a few seconds of your reading in knowing a bit about me? ...thanks :) So, I am a random programmer and a futurist techie in general (that's it).<br><br>Pardon for the interruption but let's start with the expectations now. You can expect blog posts from a varied range of topics but everything under the general umbrella of <em>futurism</em>. Anything related to engineering, technology, philosophy, psychology can be found. The posts will be designed and written in such a way (I hope so) that the readers won't lose their interest in them.<br>....<br>....<br>(Wondering what else should be included in the introduction post...) I guess that's it for the welcoming of our readers.<br><br>See you around.. reading :)"
